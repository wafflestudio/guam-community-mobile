  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: SpoqaHanSansNeoMedium
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/SpoqaHanSansNeo-Medium.ttf
          weight: 400
    - family: SpoqaHanSansNeoRegular
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/SpoqaHanSansNeo-Regular.ttf
